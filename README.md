# AngularMovieProject
This is a forntend project. Thtough it I improved my TS, HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP and more skills.
Beyond that, Angular it's my favorite framework to build the client side, And I intend to keep learning and improve my development skills.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

What did I learn from this project: 

- Create components and there relationships.
- Create services and injecting them to the component.
- Craete fake db with 'json-server' library to simulate the server-client comunication using httpClient service.
- Working with Input() and Output() to share data between the parent context and child direvtives or components.
- Working with EventEmitter to update the UI by the changes.
- Application routing: navigate, passing parameters.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
